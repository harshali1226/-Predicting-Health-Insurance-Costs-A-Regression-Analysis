 Predicting Health Insurance Costs Using Demographic and  Lifestyle Factors: A Regression Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of health insurance costs to build predictive models and gain 
insights into factors influencing insurance charges. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes 
variables such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and geographic region, along 
with the dependent variable individual medical insurance charges. The primary objective is to use 
regression techniques to model and predict insurance costs based on these attributes, identifying 
key predictors and quantifying their impact.
 Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the data structure, detect potential 
outliers, and assess relationships between features and the target variable. Linear regression models 
are initially applied to predict continuous insurance charges.
